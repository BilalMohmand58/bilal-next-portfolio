Next.js provides a powerful way to build serverless APIs using its built-in API Routes. With serverless functions, you can quickly deploy scalable APIs without managing server infrastructure.

Here are some key concepts and examples to get started:

## What are Serverless Functions?

Serverless functions are single-purpose, event-driven pieces of backend logic that execute on-demand. In the context of Next.js, serverless functions are created using API Routes in the `pages/api/` directory or the `app/api/` directory (when using the App Router).

#### Key Benefits of Serverless Functions:

- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with traffic.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Pay only for the time your code runs.
- **Ease of Use**: No need to manage servers or infrastructure.

## Emphasis

**Next.js makes API development seamless with serverless functions.**

_You can include backend logic directly in your frontend project._

### Example of a Basic API Route

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello, world!" });
}
```
